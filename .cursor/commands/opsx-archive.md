Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name after `/opsx:archive` (e.g., `/opsx:archive add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Prompt user for confirmation to continue
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Detect delta spec presence**

   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`.

   - If delta specs exist: archive will sync them into canonical specs.
   - If none exist (doc-only, infra, tooling): use `--skip-specs` so the CLI does not try to update canonical specs.

   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT compare and edit canonical specs by hand here. Canonical specs at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` are READ-ONLY for agents. Only `openspec archive` (the OpenSpec CLI) may write them.

5. **Run the archive via OpenSpec CLI (mandatory)**

   The archive MUST go through the CLI. Do NOT use `mv`, do NOT edit canonical specs by hand, do NOT script a manual sync.

   ```bash
   # With delta specs (default):
   openspec archive "<name>" --yes

   # Without delta specs (doc-only, infra, tooling):
   openspec archive "<name>" --yes --skip-specs
   ```

   The CLI does three things atomically:
   - Validates the change
   - Moves `openspec/changes/<name>/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`
   - Applies the delta into `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`

   **If the CLI fails:**
   - Surface the error message verbatim to the user
   - Do NOT fall back to `mv` or manual canonical edits
   - Help the user fix the cause (validation, existing target, etc.) and retry the CLI

   **If `openspec` is not on PATH:**
   - Stop and report it as a blocker. The archive only happens via CLI in this project.

6. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Spec sync status (synced / sync skipped / no delta specs)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Output On Success (No Delta Specs)**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** No delta specs

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Output On Success With Warnings**

```
## Archive Complete (with warnings)

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** Sync skipped (user chose to skip)

**Warnings:**
- Archived with 2 incomplete artifacts
- Archived with 3 incomplete tasks
- Delta spec sync was skipped (user chose to skip)

Review the archive if this was not intentional.
```

**Output On Error (Archive Exists)**

```
## Archive Failed

**Change:** <change-name>
**Target:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/

Target archive directory already exists.

**Options:**
1. Rename the existing archive
2. Delete the existing archive if it's a duplicate
3. Wait until a different date to archive
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (`openspec status --json`) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- **Archive MUST run through `openspec archive`. Never `mv` the folder by hand. Never edit `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` by hand.**
- If `openspec` CLI is not on PATH, stop and report it as a blocker
- Use `--skip-specs` only when the change has no delta specs
- Show clear summary of what happened
